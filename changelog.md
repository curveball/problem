Changelog
=========

1.0.0 (????-??-??)
------------------

* Finally! Curveball v1. Only took 6 years.
* CommonJS support has been dropped. The previous version of this library
  supported both CommonJS and ESM. The effort of this no longer feels worth it.
  ESM is the future, so we're dropping CommonJS.
